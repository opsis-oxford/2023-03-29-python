This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous 
programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example and is designed to be used in 
both [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] and [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] workshops. 
This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] but can be taught using alternative Python 3 interpreters
as well (e.g., repl.it, Anaconda).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1.  Learners need to understand what files and directories are,
>     what a working directory is,
>     and how to start a Python interpreter.
>
> 2. Learners must install Python 3 before the class starts.
>
> 3. Learners must get the data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file 
>    [thames_water_quality.zip]({{page.root}}/files/thames_water_quality.zip).
>
>    Please see [the setup instructions][lesson-setup]
>    for more details.
